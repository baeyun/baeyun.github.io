This is my site. It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Feel free to use this as a template.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy

You may build the site with:

```bash
yarn build:static
```

To deploy, try:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

It's that simple.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
